This is a deep learning model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN2D) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to classify
speech emotions. The project involved preprocessing audio data, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation, achieving high accuracy in recognizing different emotional states from speech.
